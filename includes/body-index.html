			<h2>Hello</h2>
			<p>Heyo this is my website. I have basically nothing here. maybe just some links to the other dumb shit I made. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>So what is this website?</h3>
			<p>Well, its my personal website, and also a gateway/hub to all my other projects. I don't really have any other reason for this, but w/e. It's basically just a random domain I felt like owning (because owning your own name is awesome), hosted on the same server as my other websites.</p>
