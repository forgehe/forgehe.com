				<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
				<h3>Traffic</h3>
				<p>
					Wanna stalk my website's success?
					<br>
					No? well...
					<br>
					<span class="fuckyouiwasright"><a href="http://kaka.moe/trafficlive.html">LIVE TRAFFIC STATS</a></span> (for kaka.moe only*)
					<br>
					There's also <a href="traffic.html">traffic.html</a> for a longer time frame (2 months) of traffic history. Updated daily (thanks cron).
					<br>
					<span style="font-size: 8pt">*Turns out having the live stats put a non-zero load on my server, so I can only handle one right now.</span>

				</p>

				<h3>Userscripts</h3>
				<p>
					Uh, I made a userscript for Facebook.com
					<br>
					and it's basically to help spam everyone on your friend list to invite people to Facebook pages
					<br>
					and it also has the functionality to add confirm friend requests if they shared a certain amount of mutual friends.
					<br>
					but it's not published anywhere, just gonna say I did it (I guess???).
